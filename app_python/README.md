## Description

This is a simple Flask web application that displays the current time in Moscow.

## Structure

- `app.py` - the main application file.
- `requirements.txt` - the list of required Python packages.
- `templates` - the directory containing HTML templates.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app_python/app.py
    ```

3. Open the web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to see the current time in
