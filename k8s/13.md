**Difference in Behavior of StatefulSet and Deployment**

The behavior is expected and is a key characteristic of how StatefulSet works. In a StatefulSet, each pod has its own
unique network identity and attached storage. This allows each pod to maintain its individual state information.

When a request is made to the application, the counter is incremented only for that specific pod. This is why the counts
differ among the pods. It's important to note that these counts can also vary based on load balancing and service
routing rules when user requests are forwarded to the pods.

**Ordering guarantees**

In certain scenarios, applications require a specific order for deploying pods to ensure proper synchronization and
consistency. For example, in a database application with multiple replicas, it may be necessary for the first pod (index

0) to be running and ready before deploying the second pod. This ensures that the second pod can sync from the first pod
   to maintain database consistency.

However, in my Flask application there is no need in specific ordering as pods do not share any resources, except from
hardware.
